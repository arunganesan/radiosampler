This set of C++ programs are used to evaluate various audio identification 
algorithms to identify the radio station. Amongst others, it will be used to 
evaluate *Shazam fingerprinting*, *Cross Correlation*, and *Relative Matching*.
It is concerned with various metrics such as how accurately each algorithm 
identifies the station, how much noise it can withstand, how quickly it can 
identify, etc. This set of programs can be used to answer questions about the 
cloud-based identification, local locking and local scanning algorithms.
